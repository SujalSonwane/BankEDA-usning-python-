##Deposits and Savings Behavior

The high correlation between Bank Deposits and Saving Accounts suggests that these may either measure overlapping financial behavior (e.g., total funds a customer keeps in the bank) or that people who actively deposit funds also tend to maintain or grow savings balances.


## Income, Age, and Accumulation

Moderate correlations of Age and Estimated Income with various balances (Superannuation, Savings, Checking) reflect a common financial lifecycle trend: higher income earners and older individuals often accumulate more savings, retirement funds, and may carry higher credit card balances or loans.


##Low Correlation with Properties Owned

Property ownership may depend on external factors (location, real estate market conditions, inheritance, etc.) that are not captured by these particular banking variables. Hence, we see weaker correlations here.


##Business vs. Personal Banking


Business Lendingâ€™s moderate link to Bank Loans suggests some customers may have both personal and business debts. However, business lending is relatively uncorrelated with other deposit or property-related metrics, indicating it may serve a distinct subset of customers or needs.
